## Name:V.Kabilan
## Problem Title
Development of e-Portal for facilitating Case Management Hearing of various types of cases
## Problem Description
Case Management Hearing, known as a Pre-Trial Conference" in other jurisdictions". This application is used for managing case files since filing to disposal and to complete all its related processes. The CMS keeps the records of all the cases filed in Delhi High Court. The system has following features: Filing of Case, Caveat matching, Allocation of case, Daily Case Proceedings, Notice Generation, Case Transfer, Case Status Search, Report, etc.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Law and Justice

## Idea
Develop an e-Portal to streamline the management of case files and proceedings from initial filing to final disposal. The portal aims to enhance efficiency, transparency, and accessibility in the judicial process by digitizing and automating various stages of Case Management Hearings (CMH), including filing, allocation, proceedings, and reporting.

## Use Cases
1.Automated Case Filing Module: An online portal with real-time validation and AI-driven document verification to streamline the filing process.

2.Caveat Matching System: A machine learning-based tool that automatically matches new case filings with existing caveats and sends real-time notifications.

3.Intelligent Case Allocation Engine: A rule-based engine that uses machine learning algorithms to allocate cases based on judges' specialization, workload, and availability.

4.Digital Courtroom Integration: A module that integrates with digital courtroom systems to automatically record proceedings, provide real-time transcriptions, and update case statuses.

5.E-Notice Generation and Delivery System: Automated notice generation with electronic delivery options (email/SMS) and a tracking system for confirmation of receipt.

6.Automated Case Transfer Workflow: A seamless workflow for case transfers between courts or judges, including a centralized data repository and digital authorization.

7.Advanced Search and Case Status Module: An NLP-powered search engine that allows users to find case statuses quickly using plain language and advanced filters.

8.Reporting and Analytics Dashboard: A real-time dashboard that provides insights into key metrics such as case backlogs, resolution times, and other analytics to improve court efficiency.

## Technology Stack
